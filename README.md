# Tic Tac Toe

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

# Calulator

This is used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

# Pizza Menu

This project is a menu used to order pizza with a selection of dressings. It then takes the input informnation and calculates a price for the order.
